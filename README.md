# Chocolate Recommender

This is a simple project that uses a neural network to predict whether a given chocolate is good or bad based on three features: whether it is dark, whether it is cheap, and whether it is branded. The model is trained on a dataset of existing chocolate ratings, and can be further improved with more data.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the [offcial Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, you will need to install the required packages. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:


```
pip install pandas sklearn tkinter
```

Finally, you can run the project by running the chocolate_recommender.py file:



```
python chocolate_recommender.py
```

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will be presented with a simple GUI. You can enter the three features for your chocolate, and click the **Predict** button to see whether the chocolate is good or bad.

You can also click the **Add Data** button to add your own chocolate ratings to the dataset. This will help improve the accuracy of the neural network over time.

This project is **ESSENTIAL** for all the *Sugar lovers*.
